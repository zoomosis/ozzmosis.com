In the 1990s before the Internet took off I was a regular user of dialup
Bulletin Board Systems. For a year or so I was co-sysop of a Melbourne
BBS named The Programmers Corner, later renamed Valhalla.

Back then I taught myself C by working on the code to various bits of open
source BBS software, particularly anything
[FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet)-related. One of those projects
was a message editor originally written by Jim Nutt named Msged which had been
ported to OS/2. I modified the user interface to more closely resemble another
message editor named GoldED, and cobbled together a Windows port.

Over the years I've kept a small collection of [BBS
software](http://blizzard.ozzmosis.com/bbs/) written in the 1990s, for
historical value. Some software was closed-source "shareware", which was common
at the time. And some of it is a bit hard to find now.
